License Plate Detection Using Mask_RCNN (Mask Region Based Proposal Convolutional Neural Network)

## Introduction

For my Flatiron School Data Science capstone project I used an object detection library known as Mask_RCNN to build a neural network that can detect license plates in photos of vehicles. A robust machine learning model with the ability to detect and store license plate information has many applications that can help consumers and businesses. The focus of my business use case research was into the implementation of neural network driven license plate detection in vehicle dash cameras.
